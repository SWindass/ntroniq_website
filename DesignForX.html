            <h1 class="header2" ;>Design for X</h1>

            <p>
                Marconi Electronics prides itself on creating excellent designs that enable the customer
                to achieve their ambitions.
            </p>

            <p>
                We incorporate design excellence at every stage of our process to ensure the the
                final product not only works but is manufacturable, testable and reliable.
            </p>

            <h2 class="header3" ;>Design for Manufacture</h2>
            <p>
                PCBs are designed to provide ease of manufacture, ensuring that the manufacturing
                process has few defects and is therefore high quality and low cost.
            </p>
            <h2 class="header3" ;>Design for Test</h2>
            <p>
                PCBs can be designed to incorporate automated testing, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Self-Test</li>
                    <li>In-circuit testing (ICT)</li>
                    <li>Automated Optical Inspection (AOI)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2 class="header3" ;>Design for Reliablity</h2>
            <p>
                Our solutions are designed to meet the reliability requirements of the customer.
            </p>
            <p>
                We perform predicted failure analysis including:
                <ul>
                    <li>MTBF calculations (Mean Time Between Failure)</li>
                    <li>FMEA Analysis (Failure Mode and Effects)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2 class="header3" ;>Design for Quality</h2>
            <p>
                The product quality has a direct impact on the products success. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Poor quality products cost more to manufacture and support, and they provide the 
                end user with a poor experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Marconi prides itself in creating high quality products by incorporation quality 
                checks at all stages of the design, and by building quality checks into the
                production system from the beginning.
            </p>
            <h2 class="header3" ;>Design for Sustainability</h2>
            <p>
                The focus of DFS is to reduce the carbon footprint as much as possible, through
                careful component selection utilising recycled materials and green manufacturing 
                processes.
            </p>
            <h2 class="header3" ;>Design for Cost</h2>
            <p>
                The overall cost of the product is considered from the start. This includes the 
                development cost and the ongoing cost of production. Individual component costs and
                component availability are considered at this stage - ensuring that the final 
                product achieves the functional requirements and that manufacturing delays caused by
                supply problems are minimised.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other key considerations include the time-to-market, component obsolescence (leading
                to redesign).
